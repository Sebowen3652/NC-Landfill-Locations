This project is the most difficulty that I have had in this class so far.
My initial idea was to create a chloropleth map with population by county.
Additionally, I wanted to have the landfills be divided into "active" and
"inactive." I a little bit dissapointed that I was not able to figure it out
in time. More specifically, I had trouble fethcing the feature.property.permitstatus
information which details "active" and "inactive." Lines 105-109 are bottlenecks
for this project.
In reflection, I think it would be beneficial to utilize this concept
for any potential final projects so that I can master this. If I did this lab
again, I think I would choose different datasets. The county dataset made it
difficult to apply population data. I was able to learn how to create custom
markers and legends (which is extremely useful).
